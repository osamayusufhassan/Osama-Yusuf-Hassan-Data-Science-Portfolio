# Data Science Projects
## [Project 1: Estimation of Future Profits for Venture Capital Investors](https://github.com/osamayusufhassan/VC_profit_estimator_multiple_linear_regression)
â€¢ Problem Statement: Create a model to estimate the future profits for venture capitalist in order to assist them in making the right investment.<br />
â€¢	Skills Accomplished: Python, sci-kit learn (Linear Regression, train_test_split), pandas, numpy, maltplotlib, OneHotEncoder, Model Evaluation using metrics R-squared.<br />
â€¢	Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook for Python, Microsoft Excel.<br />
â€¢ Predictive modelling via Multiple Linear Regression to predict score achieved by a student based upon hours of study.<br />
â€¢	Achieved an R-2 score =0.93 as a measure of goodness of fit of the model.
<br />
## [Project 2: SUV Purchase Predictor](https://github.com/osamayusufhassan/SUV-purchase-prediction-logistic-regression)
â€¢ Problem Statement: The executives of an automobile company are meeting to decide whether or not they should continue the assembly of one of their SUV models. Create a model to predict the demand of SUV among  different age groups and pay scales.<br />
â€¢	Skills Accomplished: R, Logistic Regression, Confusion Matrix, Feature Scaling, caTools for splitting data set.<br />
â€¢	Tools Used: RStudio for R, Microsoft Excel.<br />
â€¢	Built and trained Logistic Regression model to predict whether or not the customers will purchase the newly launched SUV based on features such as age and salary.<br />
## [Project 3: Prediction of Student Test Scores based on Hours of Study](https://github.com/osamayusufhassan/Linear-Regression-hours-vs-scores)
â€¢ Problem Statement: Create a model to predict the test scores of a class.<br />
â€¢	Skills Accomplished: Python, sci-kit learn (Linear Regression, train_test_split), Model Evaluation using metrics (mean absolute error, mean squared error, RMS and R-squared).<br />
Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook for Python, Microsoft Excel.<br />
â€¢ Trained a Linear Regression model to predict the test scores achieved by students based upon their respective hours of study.<br />
â€¢	Achieved an R-2 score =0.945 as a measure of goodness of fit of the model.
<br />
## [Project 4: Home Price Predictor](https://github.com/osamayusufhassan/Decision_tree_regressor_price_predictor)
â€¢	Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook for Python, Microsoft Excel.<br />
â€¢ Developed a model to predict home prices via Decision Tree Regressor.<br />
â€¢ Performed model validation and handled overfitting vs underfitting to minimize mean absolute error.<br />
